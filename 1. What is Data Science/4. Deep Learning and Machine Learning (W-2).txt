1 / 1 point

ðŸ”¥Big dataðŸ”¥

Machine learning

Deep learning

Data mining

Correct
Correct! Big data refers to data sets that are massive, quickly generated, and varied, challenging traditional analysis methods.


Question 2
How does Generative AI contribute to addressing the challenges faced by data scientists, researchers, and analysts when exploring significant data patterns and insights?

1 / 1 point

By automating the process of collecting and preprocessing data

By speeding up the traditional manual analysis process

ðŸ”¥By enabling the derivation and evaluation of hypotheses from diverse data sourcesðŸ”¥

By replacing the role of data scientists in analyzing data patterns


Correct
Correct! Generative AI helps bridge the gap by allowing the exploration and evaluation of multiple hypotheses from various data sources, enhancing decision-making.


Question 3
Imagine youâ€™re working with generative AI to create new instances of data that resemble your original datasetâ€™s patterns. Which model would you choose as the foundational deep learning approach for this task?

1 / 1 point

Decision Trees

Linear Regression

ðŸ”¥Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)ðŸ”¥

Neural Networks


Correct
Correct! GANs and VAEs are the deep learning models that form the foundation of generative AI by learning patterns from extensive data and generating new instances.


Question 4
Which technology is characterized by its ability to learn patterns on its own, such as distinguishing between objects like cats and dogs, and even generating speech that sounds like a learning baby?

1 / 1 point

ðŸ”¥Deep LearningðŸ”¥

Basic Pattern Recognition

Linear Algebra Transformations

Traditional Neural Networks


Correct
Correct! Deep learning is a technology that allows systems to learn complex patterns and features on their own, even distinguishing between objects and generating speech.


Question 5
