Question 1
What is the main purpose of data modeling in the data science methodology?

1 point

To select an appropriate analytical approach

To refine and adjust the problem statement

To collect and compile raw data

ðŸ”¥To develop models for descriptive or predictive purposesðŸ”¥



Question 2
How does a training set contribute to predictive modeling?

1 point

ðŸ”¥A training set serves as a calibration gauge for the modelðŸ”¥

It helps select appropriate algorithms

A training set provides a set of unknown outcomes

A training set contains variables that are not required for modeling



Question 3
What is the primary purpose of model evaluation in the data science methodology?

1 point

To deploy the model and monitor its performance

To refine the data collection process

ðŸ”¥To assess the quality of the model and ensure it meets the initial requestðŸ”¥

To determine the optimal parameter values for model building



Question 4
What is the purpose of diagnostic measures during model evaluation?

1 point

To refine the model's design for predictive outcomes

To assess the quality of relationships in a descriptive model

To test the model's statistical significance



Question 5
What does the ROC curve help determine in model evaluation?

1 point

The relative misclassification cost of the model

ðŸ”¥The true-positive rate and false-positive rate for different criteriaðŸ”¥
